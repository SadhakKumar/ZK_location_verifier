# 🛂 ZK-Visa: Privacy-Preserving Visa Compliance System

ZK-Visa is a decentralized, privacy-first system that leverages **blockchain**, **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, and **AI agents** to automate and enforce visa compliance without compromising user location privacy.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Zero-Knowledge Location Proofs**: Prove that you exited a country before your visa expired—without revealing where you were.
- 🤖 **AI Agent Automation**: Handles stake calculation, proof validation, and smart contract interactions.
- 🔐 **Staking System**: Users stake funds as a compliance commitment; compliant users get it back, non-compliant users get slashed.
- ⛓️ **Smart Contracts + ZK Circuits**: Fully decentralized and transparent execution.
- 💰 **Vault Contract**: Securely manages user stakes based on programmable rules.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Visa Entry & Staking**  
   - The user enters visa details.  
   - The Base Agent calculates the staking amount based on visa duration and country-specific rules.  
   - The user stakes funds via the Vault contract.

2. **Proof of Exit**  
   - Before the visa expires, the user submits a zk-SNARK proof showing they’ve exited the country.  
   - The Base Agent validates the proof.

3. **Stake Refund or Slash**  
   - If valid and on time: **Stake is refunded.**  
   - If invalid or late: **Stake is slashed.**

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Smart Contracts**: Handles user registration, staking, and refunds/slashing.
- **zk-SNARK Circuits**: Built using [snarkjs] or [circom] to verify exit proofs.
- **AI Base Agent**: Automates stake logic and triggers proof validation.
- **Vault Contract**: Manages and distributes funds securely.

## 🔐 Privacy First

ZK-Visa ensures that:
- No GPS coordinates or sensitive location data are stored or revealed.
- ZKPs only validate logical statements like _"User has exited Country X before Date Y"_.
- Only the outcome of the proof is revealed—**not the data** behind it.
